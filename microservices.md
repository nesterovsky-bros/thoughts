# Thoughts on microservices

No doubt what we express here lacks originality. We just need to contemplate on the subject and write our thoughts down, as 
requests around microservices regularly pop up in our projects, and we have to explain our position
to clients, to the management and - more importantly - to ourselves.

## On the nature of our projects

We help with migration of large projects, usually from mainframes to todayâ€™s technologies that often assume 
cloud environments and involve Java or C# on the backend and, if relevant, Angular or React on the frontend.

The projects we deal with are usually essential to a client's business, so they cannot be decommissioned or easily rewritten. 
That is where we come in with automatic and verifiable approaches.

Original projects usually follow the "classic" client-server-database scheme. They often have UI, services or batch operations. 
They have large codebases, with a complex graph of connections between programs.

## On client expectations

Clients need continuity of their projects' life and experience. They want to migrate to today's technologies. 
They want performance improvements. Ease of development and support is paramount for them. 
They often talk about migrating to the cloud. 
They know that cloud is almost equal to microservices.

## Microservices

What are they?  
We asked Copilot to draw a diagram of cloud application implemented with microservices. This is what it came with:

Well, Copilot is not great these days at drawing such diagrams, yet the idea is clear enough!

Can our projects be represented like this?
Almost, but with a couple of additions:
* there are from hundreds to thousands of services;
* there are shared code used by services.

We asked Copilot to account this, and it produced the following:

Still ugly picture, but idea is even more clear!

**Now, the question is:** can we implement original applications using this idea?  
**Our answer is:** it depends.
Depends on what?  
On goals!

## Client goals

Let's try to spell out clients' goals:
  1. Equivalent post migrated applications (modulo differences related to technology shift).
  2. Easy support and development of migrated applications.
  3. Good performance, preferrably better and more scalable than original applications.

**So, if one has purely theoretical question:** "May original monolith applications be implemented as a set of microservices in the cloud?".  
**Then the answer is:** yes.

The problem with such implementation is that it will probably be not equivalent, difficult to maintain, and slow.

1. When you split original application into microservices, you will need to keep in mind transaction boundaries.
Transaction scope must be kept unless you prove or client confirm that it's not important.

2. When you have deconstructed original application into microservices that probably sit in different source repositories, consider:
   * What will you do with shared code?
   * How are you going change it?
   * After the change of shared code, are you going to re-test and re-deploy all dependant microservices?
   * or are you going to copy it, and make it dedicated part of specific microservice?
   * Are you going to retest all dependant microservices upon change of a specific service?
   * How are you going to setup your debug environment?

3. Performance of communication of parts of application through microservices is levels of magnitudes lower than direct calls.
   If you introduce a split in a wrong place, you will kill the performance.

If you think that the problem of refactoring application into microservices is specific to legacy applications, then we have to disagree with you.
There are classes of applications that are monolith by nature, or can only be decoupled into coarse grained services.
