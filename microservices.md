# Thoughts on microservices

No doubts what we express here lacks originality. We just need to contemplate on the subject and write our thoughts down, as 
requests around microservices are regularly pop up in our projects, and we have to explain our position
to clients, to the management and more important to ourselves.

## On the nature of our projects

We help with migration of big projects, usually from Mainframes, to today's technologies that often assume cloud,
involve java or C# on backend, and, if relevant, angular or react on frontend.

The projects we are dealing with are usually essential to a client's business, so they cannot be decommissioned or easily rewritten. 
That is where we come with automatic and verifiable approaches.

Original projects usually follow "classic" - client, server and database scheme. They often have UI, services or batch operations. 
They have big code bases, with a complex graph of connections between programs.

## On client expectations

Clients need continuity of their projects' life and experience. They want to migrate to today's technologies. 
They want performance improvements. Ease of development and support is a paramount for them. 
They often talk about migration to a cloud. 
They know that cloud is almost equal to microservices.

## Microservices

What are them?  
I asked Copilot to draw a diagram of cloud application implemented with microservices. This is what it came with:

I tend to say that Copilot is bad now days at drawing such diagram, yet idea is clear enough!
